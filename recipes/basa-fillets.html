    delicate flavour similar to cod. Served with lightly crushed 
    garlic potatoes and a fresh and zesty chilli and coriander 
    salsa, this makes a delicious dinner and is ready in just 15 
    minutes. What's more, it's high in protein and a source of 
    vitamin C, too.</em></h5>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>350g (12 1/2oz) baby potatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp rice wine vinegar or white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>½ lime, zested and juiced</li>
        <li>1 red chilli, seeded and finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>3-4 tbsp roughly chopped coriander</li>
        <li>1½ tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tbsp plain flour</li>
        <li>1 x 265g (9 1/2oz) pack skinless and boneless basa fillets</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>In a medium pan of salted, boiling water, cook the potatoes for 12 mins, or until tender.</li>
        <li>While the potatoes are cooking, make the salsa: in a bowl, combine the extra-virgin olive oil, vinegar, lime zest and half the lime juice, the chilli, half the garlic, and the coriander. Season and add extra lime juice to taste, if you like.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large frying pan over a high heat. Season the flour and use to coat the basa fillets, then add them to the pan. Fry for 30 secs over a high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-high and fry for a further 2 mins each side, or until golden and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Drain the potatoes. Return to the pan, along with the remaining olive oil and garlic. Lightly crush with a potato masher or a fork, then divide between 2 plates. Top with the fish and drizzle over the chilli and coriander salsa.</li>
    </ol>
